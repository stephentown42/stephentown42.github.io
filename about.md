I work in a variety of programming languages including Python, SQL, R and Matlab to create data pipelines and machine learning models. These models are designed to capture the drivers of sensory perception, measured using a variety of behavioral and neurophysiological methods. I have published insights from my research in a number of peer-reviewed scientific journals, with the goal of furthering our fundamental understanding of brain function so that we can develop healthcare technologies to fight disease and enhance cognition.
