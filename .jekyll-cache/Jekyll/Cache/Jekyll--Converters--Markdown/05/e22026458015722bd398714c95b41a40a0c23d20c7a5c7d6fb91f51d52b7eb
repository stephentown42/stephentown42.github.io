I"'<p>I’m pleased to announce the publication of our study on the coordinate frames of spatial hearing in this week’s issue of The Journal of Neuroscience. The paper was posted on BioRxiv a few months ago and has now been peer-reviewed for J. Neurosci. The full paper is available here, but this blog post outlines the main take-home points from the study?</p>

<p><strong>What’s the study about?</strong><br />
My research is interested in understanding how listeners infer the location of sounds in auditory scenes. For us as humans, we often think of sounds as being located in specific spaces; for example, when your alarm clock rings, you can say “the clock is by my bed” or “the clock is on my left”. These two descriptions reflect different coordinate frames in which space is defined - either by objects in the world (sometimes called allocentric space) or by the observer (sometimes called egocentric space). The core distinction between these spaces is that world-centered space is stable when we move; the alarm clock is still beside the bed after you’ve got up to brush your teeth, but (because you’ve moved) the position of the clock has changed relative to you. We know that humans can easily access information about sound location in both these spaces, but now we show the same ability in animals (ferrets)</p>

<p><strong>How can you show how animals think?</strong><br />
Obviously animals can’t talk directly to us and describe their experience. One way around this is to design tasks that have unique solutions; if the animal can solve the task, it must be able to access information underlying the solution.</p>

<p>Here, we designed a task that could only be solved by localizing sounds in the world; it works by presenting ferrets with sounds from one of two locations (East or West) and asking them to report which location was presented at two response ports in the North or South of a test arena. To intiate sound presentation, the animal has to stand in the center of the area, but the direction of the head changes across trials.</p>
