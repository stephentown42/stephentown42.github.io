Welcome to the research homepage for me, Stephen Town. Iâ€™m currently a senior research associate at University College London, working in the field of sensory, behavioral and systems neuroscience. My research asks how the activity of neurons in the brain gives rise to perception, with a specific focus on hearing and multisensory integration.
